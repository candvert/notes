Even if we have no terminal emulator running, several terminal sessions 
continue to run behind the graphical desktop. Called virtual terminals or virtual
consoles, these sessions can be accessed on most Linux distributions by pressing
CTRL-ALT-F1 through CTRL-ALT-F6 on most systems. When a session is accessed, it
presents a login prompt into which we can enter our username and password.
To switch from one virtual console to another, press ALT and F1â€“F6. To return
to the graphical desktop, press ALT-F7.
