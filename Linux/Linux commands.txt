Even if we have no terminal emulator running, several terminal sessions 
continue to run behind the graphical desktop. Called virtual terminals or virtual
consoles, these sessions can be accessed on most Linux distributions by pressing
CTRL-ALT-F1 through CTRL-ALT-F6 on most systems. When a session is accessed, it
presents a login prompt into which we can enter our username and password.
To switch from one virtual console to another, press ALT and F1–F6. To return
to the graphical desktop, press ALT-F7.

	CTRL-Y Yank text from the kill-ring and insert it at the cursor location.
}

Search History
!number (carry out the number command in the command history, which is in .bash_history)
first enter CTRL-R perform a reverse incremental search in command history, which means as search as you enter characters, press CTRL-j to copy the line from search to current command line, to find the next occurrence of the text, press CTRL-R again. To quit searching, press either CTRL-G or CTRL-C.

File Types (-rw-rw-rw-) {
	- 		A regular file.
	d 		A directory.
	l 		A symbolic link. Notice that with symbolic links, the remaining file attributes are always rwxrwxrwx and are dummy values. The real file attributes are those of the file the symbolic link points to.
	c 		A character special file. This file type refers to a device that handles data as a stream of bytes, such as a terminal or modem.
	b 		A block special file. This file type refers to a device that handles data in blocks, such as a hard drive or CD-ROM drive.
}

Permission Attributes {
	                Files 										Directories
	r               Allows a file to be opened and read.		Allows a directory’s

}

chmod 700 filename/directory 		 chmod [a,u,g,o] [+,-,=] [r,w,x] (only file/directory owner and superuser can change file mode)
umask 0002 (if umask is 0000, the new file created with attributes -rw-rw-rw-, which is default file attributes, through umask we can remove some of those attributes)
su - [user] (change to user)		su -c 'command' (pass the command to new shell)

ps (report a snapshot of the current processes)
top (display Linux processes)

Process States {
	R 	Running. The process is running or ready to run.
	S 	Sleeping. The process is not running; rather, it is waiting for an event, such as a keystroke or network packet.
	D 	Uninterruptible sleep. Process is waiting for I/O such as a disk drive.
	T 	Stopped. Process has been instructed to stop (more on this later).
	Z 	A defunct or “zombie” process. This is a child process that has terminated but has not been cleaned up by its parent.
	< 	A high-priority process. It’s possible to grant more importance to a process, giving it more time on the CPU. This property of a process is called niceness. A process with high priority is said to be less nice because it’s taking more of the CPU’s time, which leaves less for everybody else.
	N 	A low-priority process. A process with low priority (a nice process) will get processor time only after other processes with higher priority have been serviced.
}

BSD-Style ps Column Headers (ps aux) {
	USER 	User ID. This is the owner of the process.
	%CPU 	CPU usage as a percent.
	%MEM 	Memory usage as a percent.
	VSZ 	Virtual memory size.
	RSS 	Resident Set Size. The amount of physical memory (RAM) the process is using in kilobytes.
	START 	Time when the process started. For values over 24 hours, a date is used.
}
